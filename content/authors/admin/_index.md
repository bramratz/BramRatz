Hi, I'm Bram, I'm a data science enthusiast with a Masters degree in Bioinformatics & a Bsc Honours specialization in Genetics. My Masters research focused on determining the impact filtering has on data retention and estimations of ancestry and to estimate hybrid ancestry in second generation hybrids of two species: the endangered Greenback Cutthroat trout and the closely related Colorado River Cutthroat.
